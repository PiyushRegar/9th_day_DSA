ay 9 of My DSA Journey ✅  ✨ Explored Vectors in Lecture 9! Understood how dynamic arrays make handling data collections easier and more flexible.

Vectors in C++

Overview

Vectors are a part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in C++ and provide a dynamic array implementation. Unlike regular arrays, vectors can grow and shrink in size automatically, making them highly versatile and easy to use.

Features of Vectors:

Dynamic Resizing: Automatically resizes as elements are added or removed.

Random Access: Provides constant time access to elements using an index.

Efficient Insertion and Deletion: Offers efficient operations at the end of the vector.

Standardized Interface: Includes a wide range of member functions for manipulation.
